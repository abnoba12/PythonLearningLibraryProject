# Introduction to Python Programming: Building a Personal Library Management System

## Introduction

Welcome to the Python Programming course! In this course, we will learn Python by building a practical application: a Personal Library Management System. The goal of this course is to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Python programming. This course is structured so that you will be building a single console application over the durration.
